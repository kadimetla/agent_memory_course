"""Knowledge Base layer — the Acme Cloud corpus, ingested via memorizz `KnowledgeBase`.

Mirrors notebook §5: each doc is ingested as a single document (``chunking_strategy
="none"``) into one namespace, then retrieved by vector similarity. Seeding is
idempotent and cached, so the first call warms it and later calls are instant.
The docs are the same synthetic Acme Cloud corpus used across the workshop.
