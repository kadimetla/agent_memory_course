"""Layer 5 — Shared memory: multi-agent coordination (observable).

A Lead delegates to a Researcher and a Reviewer, then synthesizes one
recommendation. The hand-offs are mediated by a `SharedMemory` blackboard and
streamed as `flow` events so the UI can render the live agentic data flow; each
agent's context window is streamed as `agent_context` for the hover view.

memorizz also ships `MultiAgentOrchestrator`, which runs this exact pattern
opaquely over shared memory — here we drive it explicitly so every instruction
and report passing between agents is observable in real time.
